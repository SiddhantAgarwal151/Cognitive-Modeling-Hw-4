    "My main takeaway from this course was that a useful model is not a perfect model. I had previously held the belief that the best model would be one that could perfectly recreate real life. I thought that, as computing power became great enough, we could model occurances in their entirety as many times over as we like to create perfect models. But, as I learned in this course, that would entirely defeat the purpose of the model and make it no more usable than simply measuring things in real life. Like a map which covers the whole nation it is more useful to have a less faithful yet more manageable model.  \n",
    "A secondary consequence of this takeaway is that I am very glad so much is normally distributed, and that people smarter than I have already made the tools necessary for that modeling among many others. Absolute praise for the people who work on tools like stan, tensorflow, keras, etc."
